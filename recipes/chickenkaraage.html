                <div class="paragraph">Karaage Chicken is one of the most popular Japanese dishes not only within Japan but abroad as well. The chicken is marinated with soy sauce, sake, ginger, and mirin to give a touch of sweetness.</div>
                <div class="paragraph">Karaage originally meant deep fried meat or fish without any marinating. The cooking method of pre-marinating ingredients came from China in the early Edo period. At the time, Japanese people called China ‘tou’ (唐), but this kanji character can also read ‘kara‘, particularly when combined with other characters. Hence the word 唐揚げ became ‘karaage’  instead of ‘touage‘.
