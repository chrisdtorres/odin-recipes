        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This comforting Shoyu Ramen is sheer perfection. Master Ueda of the famous Tokyo ramen shop Bizentei has generously shared his recipe that I’ve scaled here to a family-friendly portion. The slow-cooked, soy sauce-based broth extracts a deep flavor while the tender chashu (Japanese braised pork belly) simply melts in your mouth. Despite the long simmering time, the active cooking is just 30 minutes, so it‘s easy to make this authentic Tokyo-style ramen at home.</p>
